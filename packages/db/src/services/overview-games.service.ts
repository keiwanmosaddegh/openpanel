/**
 * Per-game breakdown for the overview "Games" widget (fork-only).
 *
 * One row per resolved game key, with the metrics stakeholders compare games on
 * — reach (players / sessions), volume (puzzles opened), quality (completion
 * rate), loyalty (returning rate) and effort (median time to solve) — plus a
 * daily series per row for the sparkline.
 *
 * Fork-safe: its own file, appended endpoint. Upstream's overview.service.ts is
 * untouched apart from the constants it already owns (see below).
 *
 * Two queries rather than one, deliberately. PostHog folds a breakdown's
 * per-row series into the aggregate query with a CTE chain, which works because
 * its row totals are sums of the daily values. Ours are not: `players` and
 * `sessions` are distinct counts over the whole range, and summing per-day
 * uniques would count a player who returned on five days five times. The two
 * grains therefore need two aggregations; they run in parallel and are cached
 * by the router.
 *
 * Both run on the overview's cold load, where cost scales with the largest
 * project rather than the median one — read materialized columns here, never
 * `properties`.
